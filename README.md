# Kado
Kado turns screen recordings into bug reports. Upload a narrated Loom or demo video and Kado detects where something breaks, then generates timestamped, copy-paste-ready reports with steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior—so you don’t have to rewatch demos or manually write tickets.
